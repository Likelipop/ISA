    \frametitle{Introduction to A/B Testing}
    A/B Testing, also known as Split Testing, 
    is a research methodology 
    where two versions of a variable (A and B) are compared simultaneously 
    to determine which one performs better against a defined goal.

    \begin{block}{Role in Data Science}
        A/B testing is a foundational technique in data science 
        that engineering and product teams use to validate decisions 
        with real-world data. At its core, 
        it’s about understanding what changes 
        improve user experience, conversion, or retention.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scientific Validation:} A/B Testing is a 
        Randomized Controlled Experiment  
        validating user experiences design changes based on objective evidence, 
        not subjective opinion.
        \item \textbf{Core Function:} It measures the isolated impact of a single change (e.g., \alert{headline}, \alert{button placement}) on user behavior.
        \item \textbf{Primary Goal:} Maximize key performance indicators (KPIs) like \textbf{Conversion Rate} and \textbf{Revenue Per User}.
